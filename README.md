# Spooky World

Spooky World is horror version of executing the Parallax Effect using HTML, Css and Javascript.


âœ¨Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website background moves at a slower pace than the foreground. This results in a 3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth and creating a more immersive browsing experience.   Parallax is based on optical illusion. Since the human eye perceives objects that are close to us as larger than things farther away, we perceive distant objects as if they were moving more slowly.

## Installation

Installation of my project is very simple. 

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/chakitg/spooky-world.git
```
This will clone the repository in your local device.

Then we need to change the directory.

```bash
  cd spooky-world
```

Then type "code ." to open it in VS Code (or any other IDE).
```bash

Then Go live with your IDE.

BOOM!! There you have it.
